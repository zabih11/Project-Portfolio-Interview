## ðŸ¤– Assistive Autonomous Robot with Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, and SLAM

An advanced robotics project integrating:

- **Real-time object detection** using YOLOv4 and OpenCV
- **Voice command processing** through Vosk for offline speech recognition
- **Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)** for autonomous navigation
- **Integration with ROS and Gazebo** for robotic simulation

The system enables autonomous assistive behavior through multimodal AI and real-world simulation environments.

## ðŸ“ˆ Stock Trend Forecasting

A machine learning pipeline for forecasting stock price movements:

- **Data retrieval and feature engineering** from historical financial data
- **Model training** with LSTM and technical indicators
- **Model evaluation** using accuracy, F1 score, and loss tracking
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for visualization and interactive experimentation

This project demonstrates time series prediction, classification, and data visualization techniques in finance.
