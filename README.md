## ðŸ¤– Assistive Autonomous Robot with Computer Vision, Speech Recognition, and SLAM

### Overview
An advanced robotics project integrating:

- **Real-time object detection:**  
  Powered by a custom YOLOv5 model and PyTorch for robust and accurate identification of common household objects.
  
- **Hand gesture control:**  
  Utilises MediaPipe to enable intuitive manipulation of the robotâ€™s arm and grabber. Your hand and arm movements are directly interpreted as joint angles, allowing the robot to replicate your motions.

- **Object grabbing and retrieval pipeline:**  
  The robot autonomously detects target items, approaches them, uses its grabber to securely grasp them, and places them in a designated holder or basket.

- **Voice command processing:**  
  Seamlessly integrated through Google Speech-to-Text for recognising natural language commands. Commands such as "grab the orange" or "manual" automatically switch the robot to corresponding modes.

- **Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM):**  
  Utilises a LiDAR sensor to create accurate maps of its environment for autonomous navigation and collision avoidance.

- **Integration with ROS2:**  
  Allows for distributed robotic control and real-time navigation through custom nodes and configurations.

### Features
The system demonstrates multimodal AI capabilities for:
- **Follow-Me Functionality:** Using SLAM data and holistic pose tracking, the robot can follow you while maintaining a safe distance.
- **Multimodal Navigation:** The robot autonomously scans rooms, maps the environment, and plans paths to avoid obstacles.
- **Natural Control Modes:** Switch seamlessly between manual hand gesture control, object retrieval mode, and autonomous follow-me mode.


## ðŸ”§ Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python** for developing key algorithms and integration scripts.
- **ROS2** for distributed control, SLAM, and navigation planning.
- **OpenCV** for computer vision tasks and user interface development.
- **YOLOv5** for custom object detection and recognition.
- **SpeechRecognition** (Google Speech-to-Text API) for voice command processing.
- **MediaPipe** for hand gesture and holistic tracking.
- **SLAM** using a LiDAR sensor for mapping and localisation.

These were the core technologies employed to bring the projectâ€™s functionality to life, combining vision, voice, and navigation seamlessly.

## ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Analysis and Forecasting

### Overview
A data-driven project designed to analyse and forecast stock prices using:

- **Real-time data retrieval:**  
  Daily stock price data is fetched using the AlphaVantage API, covering a defined date range for any specified company.

- **Data storage and management:**  
  MongoDB is used for storing and managing historical stock price data, allowing for effective querying and updates.

- **Data preprocessing:**  
  Handles missing values, removes outliers, and normalises data to ensure accurate analysis and modelling.

- **Time series modelling:**  
  Forecasts future stock prices using ARIMA models to identify trends and predict future movements.

- **CRUD operations:**  
  Includes Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing stored stock data in MongoDB.

- **Data visualisation:**  
  Generates insightful plots for stock price trends, outlier detection, and forecasting results.

### Features
The system demonstrates end-to-end data processing and forecasting capabilities, including:

- **Data Pipeline:** Efficient retrieval, cleaning, and storage of stock data for easy management.  
- **Predictive Modelling:** ARIMA models for accurate time series forecasting of stock prices.  
- **Interactive Management:** CRUD operations enable dynamic updates and management of the database.  
- **Visual Insights:** Graphs and plots provide a comprehensive understanding of stock behaviours and forecasts.

## ðŸ”§ Skills and Technologies Used

- **Python** for scripting and implementation.  
- **MongoDB** for cloud-based data storage and management.  
- **AlphaVantage API** for real-time stock data retrieval.  
- **ARIMA (Time Series Modelling)** for stock price forecasting.  
- **Data Preprocessing Libraries:** Pandas and NumPy for cleaning and formatting data.  
- **Data Visualisation Tools:** Matplotlib and Seaborn for trend analysis and evaluation.

These technologies are integrated to create a seamless, data-focused pipeline for stock price analysis.
